        <h2>Baked chicken with a lemon sauce</h2>
            <p>This a great recipe that my family loves. It's fairly quick and easy, and you more than likely don't have to go out and buy any new ingredients!</p>

            <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
                <li>¼ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs</li>
                <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>    
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Heat olive oil and garlic in a small saucepan over low heat until warmed, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour into a shallow bowl.</li>
                <li>Combine bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in a separate shallow bowl.</li>
                <li>Use tongs to dip chicken breasts in olive oil-garlic mixture, then coat evenly in bread crumb mixture. Transfer coated chicken to a shallow baking dish.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink and juices run clear, 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            </ol>
